● Create a Python file called holiday.py.
● Your task will be to calculate a user’s total holiday cost, which includes the
plane cost, hotel cost, and car-rental cost.
● First, get the following user inputs:
○ city_flight: The city they will be flying to. (You can create some
options for them. Remember each city will have different flight
costs.)
○ num_nights: The number of nights they will be staying at a hotel
○ rental_days: The number of days for which they will be hiring a
car.
● Next, create the following four functions:
● hotel_cost: This function will take num_nights as an argument,
and return a total cost for the hotel stay (you can choose the price
per night charged at the hotel).
