Create a new file called challenge_2.py.
● Write Python code to take the name of a user's favourite restaurant and
store it in a variable called string_fav.
● Below this, write a statement to take in the user's favourite number. Use
casting to store it in an integer variable called int_fav.
● Print out both of these using two separate print statements below what
you have written. Be careful!
● Once this is working, try to cast string_fav to an integer. What happens?
Add a comment in your code to explain why this is
