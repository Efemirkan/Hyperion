● Imagine you are running a cafe. Create a new Python file in your folder
called cafe.py.
● Create a list called menu, which should contain at least four items sold in
the cafe.
● Next, create a dictionary called stock, which should contain the stock
value for each item on your menu.
● Create another dictionary called price, which should contain the prices for
each item on your menu.
● Next, calculate the total_stock worth in the cafe. You will need to
remember to loop through the appropriate dictionaries and lists to do
this.
